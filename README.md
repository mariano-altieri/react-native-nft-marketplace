## Installation

### Step 1: Environment setup

Follow React Native + Expo setup instructions [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

### Step 2: Node dependencies

```
yarn
```

### Step 3: Run your app

```
yarn start
```

If Expo gets slugish or doesn't load as expected, just add `-c` to clear its cache: `yarn start -c`

Scan QR code with your own device using the previously installed `Expo Go` application.

If you want to use emulation tools:

```
yarn android
```

or

```
yarn ios
```
